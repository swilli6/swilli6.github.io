## Introduction

I have a MA degree in Linguistics from the University of Tampere (2011). I am now studying at the University of Helsinki in the **Linguistic Diversity and Digital Humanities MA program** (Language Technology track), expecting to graduate in 2023. 

In my free time I'm an avid knitter and sewist and I make most of my clothes, and those of my 7-year-old son (sometimes my husband, too!)
